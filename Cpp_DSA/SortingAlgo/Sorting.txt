Types of sorting algorithm

1) Bubble
2) Insertion sort
3) Selection sort
4) Heap sort
5) Merge sort
6) Quck sort
7) Tree sort
8) Sheel sort    

The above algorithms are called as Comparison algorithms.They sort the elements by comparing with other elements
Time complexity of these algorithms :
1, 2, 3 :- O(n^2)

4,5,6,7 :- O(nlogn) 

Shell sort - O(n^3/2) 




// Index based sorts 
9) Count sort
10)Bucket/bin sort
11)Radix sort
